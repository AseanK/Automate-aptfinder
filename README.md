# Automated Apartmentfinder Information Collection and Google Sheet Integration

This repository contains an automation script designed to gather housing information from ApartmentFinder and automatically populate a Google Sheet with the collected data. The script is developed using [Python], making it easy to customize and adapt to different websites and data sources. It was created for my personal use.

Features:
- Web Scraping: The script utilizes web scraping techniques to extract housing information such as website URLs, prices, and addresses from target websites. It is built with robust scraping libraries to handle different page structures and dynamic content.
- Data Parsing: Once the information is collected, the script efficiently parses and organizes the data for easy integration into a Google Sheet.

Benefits:
- Time-saving Automation: With this script, the manual effort of gathering housing information and inputting it into a spreadsheet is eliminated. The automated process ensures that the most up-to-date housing data is readily available in the Google Sheet.
- Data Consistency and Accuracy: The script maintains data consistency by extracting information in a structured manner and populating the Google Sheet accurately. It minimizes human error and provides a reliable source of housing information.

Usage:
1. Download the browser driver (preferably Chrome).
2. Create a Google form with Address, Price and url.
3. Configure the script with the target websites.
4. Run the script, and it will automatically gather the housing information and update the designated Google Sheet.

Please note that the usage of this script should comply with the terms of service and policies of the targeted websites. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary permissions.
